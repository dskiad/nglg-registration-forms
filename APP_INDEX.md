## Separation of the two applications

The applications share this GitHub repository only for version control. They must remain separate in operation:

1. Each form uses its own folder.
2. Each form should use its own Google Apps Script project.
3. Each form has its own Web App deployment.
4. Each form writes to its own Google Sheet structure.
5. Files from one folder must not be copied into the other Apps Script project.

## Privacy

No participant registrations, mobile-message lists, email addresses, phone numbers, travel details or credentials should be committed to GitHub. All operational data remains in access-controlled Google Sheets.
